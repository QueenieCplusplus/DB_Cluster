# DB Cluster

 NDB API

   NDB API app access the NDB Cluster's data store directly, without requiring a MySQL Server as an intermediary. This means that such apps are not bound by the MySQL privilege system; any NDB API app has R/W access to any NDB table stored in the same NDB Cluster at any time without restriction. (sync replica & cluster of nodes to do extensions.)

   It is possible to distribute the MySQL grant tables, converting them from the default storage engine to NDB. Once this has been done, NDB API apps can access any of the MySQL grant tables. This means that such apps can r/w user names, passwords, and any other data stored in these tables.


* NDB scans = SQL cursors 

      table scans and row scans.

* error-handling 

       to provide a means of recovering from failed operations and other problems.

* Check Point

Local checkpoint (LCP).  This is a checkpoint that is specific to a single node; however, LCPs take place for all nodes in the cluster more or less concurrently. 

An LCP involves saving all of a node's data to disk, and so usually occurs every few minutes, depending upon the amount of data stored by the node.

More detailed information about LCPs and their behavior can be found in the MySQL Manual; see in particular Defining NDB Cluster Data Nodes.

Global checkpoint (GCP).  A GCP occurs every few seconds, when transactions for all nodes are synchronized and the REDO log is flushed to disk.


A related term is GCI, which stands for “Global Checkpoint ID”. This marks the point in the REDO log where a GCP took place.


* Node

  * A component of NDB Cluster. 3 node types are supported:

     * A management (MGM) node is an instance of ndb_mgmd, the NDB Cluster management server daemon.

     * A data node an instance of ndbd, the NDB Cluster data storage daemon, and stores NDB Cluster data. This may also be an instance of ndbmtd, a multithreaded version of ndbd.

     * An API nodeis an application that accesses NDB Cluster data. SQL node refers to a mysqld (MySQL Server) process that is connected to the NDB Cluster as an API node.


* Failover 容錯備援功能

   * Node failure.  
   
   An NDB Cluster is not solely dependent upon the functioning of any single node making up the cluster, which can continue to run even when one node fails.

   * Node restart.  
   
   The process of restarting an NDB Cluster node which has stopped on its own or been stopped deliberately. This can be done for several different reasons, listed here:
   
   
     (1) Restarting a node which has shut down on its own. (This is known as forced shutdown or node failure; the other cases discussed here involve manually shutting down the node and restarting it).

     (2) To update the node's configuration.

     (3) As part of a software or hardware upgrade.

     (4) In order to defragment the node's DataMemory.

For more information about these node types, please refer to Section 1.3.3, “Review of NDB Cluster Concepts”, or to NDB Cluster Programs, in the MySQL Manual.


   * itial node restart. 

The process of starting an NDB Cluster node with its file system having been removed. This is sometimes used in the course of software upgrades and in other special circumstances.

   * System crash (system failure)  

This can occur when so many data nodes have failed that the NDB Cluster's state can no longer be guaranteed.

   * System restart

The process of restarting an NDB Cluster and reinitializing its state from disk logs and checkpoints. This is required after any shutdown of the cluster, planned or unplanned.

   * Fragment

Contains a portion of a database table. In the NDB storage engine, a table is broken up into and stored as a number of subsets, usually referred to as fragments. A fragment is sometimes also called a partition.

   * Replica 

Under the NDB storage engine, each table fragment has number of replicas in order to provide redundancy.

   * Transporter

A protocol providing data transfer across a network. The NDB API supports three different types of transporter connections: TCP/IP (local), TCP/IP (remote), and SHM. TCP/IP is, of course, the familiar network protocol that underlies HTTP, FTP, and so forth, on the Internet. SHM stands for Unix-style shared memory segments.

   * NDB
   
   This originally stood for “Network DataBase”. It now refers to the MySQL storage engine (named NDB or NDBCLUSTER) used to enable the NDB Cluster distributed database system.

  * ACC (Access Manager)

An NDB kernel block that handles hash indexes of primary keys providing speedy access to the records. For more information, see The DBACC Block.

  * TUP (Tuple Manager)

This NDB kernel block handles storage of tuples (records) and contains the filtering engine used to filter out records and attributes when performing reads or updates. See The DBTUP Block, for more information.

   * TC (Transaction Coordinator)  

Handles coordination of transactions and timeouts in the NDB kernel (see The DBTC Block). Provides interfaces to the NDB API for performing indexes and scan operations.
